# Flights Fare Prediction

The project is based on a supervised machine learning algorithm called Random Forest.
Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification and regression. They create a number of decision trees under the hood at the time of training the model and outputs on the basis of averaging techniques in case of regression, which is used here.
